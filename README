# Kirk's Blogofile add-ons

## drupalmigrate.py

Convert your old Drupal site to Blogofile the lazy way! Run both at the same
time and migrate at your own pace.

## photo_gallery.py

The photo gallery you've wanted with features like nested albums, Markdown
captions for everything, autogenerated thumbnails, navigation breadcrumbs,
and Disqus comments.

Both scripts are heavily commented to explain installation and usage.
